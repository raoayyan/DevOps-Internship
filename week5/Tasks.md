**What is Kanban and Kaban Board?**

Kanban is a method for managing and improving workflow and productivity, particularly in manufacturing, software development, 
and other knowledge work. It originated in Japan and is based on the principles of just-in-time production and lean manufacturing.
The word "kanban" in Japanese literally means "signboard" or "billboard."

A kanban board is a visual tool used to implement the kanban system. It typically consists of a physical or digital board divided into columns that represent the 
different stages of a workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each column contains cards or sticky notes representing individual tasks or work items,
with additional information such as priority, deadlines, and assignees. The board provides a quick and easy way to visualize the flow of work, identify bottlenecks 
and delays, and optimize the process for greater efficiency and effectiveness. Kanban boards are used in a wide range of industries and contexts, from software 
development to healthcare to personal productivity.

**What are the core principles of Kanban?**

The core principles of Kanban are:

Visualize the workflow: This involves creating a visual representation of the work process, such as a Kanban board, to provide a clear and transparent view of the 
work and its progress.

Limit work in progress: By limiting the number of tasks or work items that can be in progress at any given time, the team can reduce the likelihood of bottlenecks, 
overburdening team members, and reduce multitasking.

Manage flow: Focus on ensuring that work flows smoothly through the system, without getting stuck or delayed.

Make process policies explicit: Make the policies and rules of the process transparent and clear to all team members to ensure that everyone understands their 
role and how the process works.

Implement feedback loops: Establish feedback loops to gather feedback and insights from team members, customers, and stakeholders to continuously improve the process.

Improve collaboratively and evolve experimentally: Encourage continuous experimentation and collaboration among team members to identify and implement process 
improvements iteratively.

By following these principles, teams can improve their efficiency, productivity, and quality of work, while also fostering a culture of continuous improvement and 
learning.

**What is Scrum? What are the different roles in the scrum (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Scrum Team )?**

Scrum is an Agile framework for managing and completing complex projects, particularly in software development. It is based on the principles of transparency, 
inspection, and adaptation. Scrum emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and iterative development to deliver value to the customer early and often.

There are three main roles in Scrum:

Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of all the features, requirements, and 
enhancements that need to be developed. The Product Owner represents the customer or stakeholder and is responsible for ensuring that the team delivers value 
to the customer by working on the highest-priority items in the backlog.

Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for facilitating the Scrum process and ensuring that the team follows the Scrum framework. The Scrum Master 
coaches and mentors the team to improve their performance, removes any impediments or obstacles that may prevent the team from achieving its goals, and helps 
the team to continuously improve its processes and practices.

Scrum Team: The Scrum Team is a self-organizing and cross-functional team that is responsible for delivering the product increment. The team includes developers, 
testers, designers, and other roles as needed to complete the work. The Scrum Team is responsible for estimating the work, committing to the work during the Sprint 
planning, and completing the work within the Sprint timebox.

**What are the benefits of scrum?**

There are several benefits of using the Scrum framework:

Improved productivity: Scrum helps to improve productivity by providing a framework that emphasizes teamwork, collaboration, and iterative development. 
The team is empowered to self-organize and take ownership of their work, resulting in increased motivation and productivity.

Better quality: By focusing on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each Sprint, Scrum ensures that the team delivers high-quality 
work that meets the customer's requirements. The team also incorporates continuous feedback and testing into their development process, further improving the quality 
of the product.

Increased customer satisfaction: Scrum puts the customer at the center of the development process by involving the Product Owner in prioritizing the product backlog 
and ensuring that the team delivers value to the customer at the end of each Sprint. This results in increased customer satisfaction and a better understanding of 
customer needs and requirements.

Faster time-to-market: Scrum allows teams to deliver working software in short iterations, which enables faster time-to-market and quicker response to changing 
requirements and market conditions.

Improved team morale: Scrum empowers the team to self-organize, collaborate, and continuously improve, resulting in a more motivated and engaged team. This, in turn, 
leads to improved team morale, job satisfaction, and retention.

**What are user stories and story points? What are INVEST characteristics of a story? What is epic?**

User stories are a way of capturing and communicating requirements in Agile software development. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality 
that describes what the user wants to achieve and why. User stories are often written in a specific format: "As a [user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."

Story points, on the other hand, are a relative measure of the effort required to complete a user story. They are used by Agile teams to estimate the effort required 
to complete a user story in comparison to other user stories in the product backlog. Story points are typically determined by the team during the Sprint planning 
session, using a technique such as planning poker.

INVEST is an acronym that stands for the following characteristics of a good user story:

Independent: User stories should be self-contained and independent of each other, so that they can be developed and tested separately.

Negotiable: User stories should be flexible and open to negotiation and discussion between the Product Owner and the development team.

Valuable: User stories should provide value to the customer and align with the overall product vision and goals.

Estimable: User stories should be able to be estimated in terms of effort, using techniques such as story points.

Small: User stories should be small and focused, so that they can be completed in a single Sprint.

Testable: User stories should be testable, with clear acceptance criteria that can be used to verify that the story is complete.

An epic is a large user story that cannot be completed within a single Sprint. Epics are broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories that can be 
completed in a single Sprint. Epics are typically used to describe a larger feature or functionality that requires multiple user stories to complete.

**What is a sprint? How long should it be?**

A Sprint is a timeboxed iteration in Agile software development where the development team works to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. 
It is a fixed period of time during which the team works on a set of features or requirements from the product backlog.

The length of a Sprint can vary, but it is typically two to four weeks long. The Scrum framework recommends a Sprint length of two weeks, but the team can choose 
a length that works best for them based on factors such as team size, project complexity, and organizational constraints.

During the Sprint, the team works to complete the user stories or tasks that they have committed to delivering during the Sprint planning session. The team meets 
daily for the daily Scrum meeting to discuss progress, identify and resolve any issues, and plan their work for the next day.

At the end of the Sprint, the team delivers a potentially shippable product increment that has been tested and meets the Definition of Done. The Sprint review 
meeting is held to demonstrate the completed work to the stakeholders and gather feedback for the next Sprint. The Sprint retrospective meeting is held to reflect 
on the Sprint and identify areas for improvement in the next Sprint.

**What is a product backlog? What are effective ways to build a product backlog? What is backlog refinement?**

A product backlog is a prioritized list of user stories and requirements that describe the functionality and features of a product. The product backlog is 
maintained and prioritized by the Product Owner, and it is used by the development team to plan and deliver the product increment during each Sprint.

Effective ways to build a product backlog include:

Identify the product vision and goals: The product backlog should align with the overall vision and goals of the product. The Product Owner should work with 
stakeholders to identify and prioritize the most important features and requirements.

Prioritize the backlog: The backlog should be prioritized based on the value to the customer and the business. The most important and high-priority user stories 
should be at the top of the backlog.

Break down large requirements: Large requirements or epics should be broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories that can be completed within a single 
Sprint.

Collaborate with the development team: The development team should be involved in the backlog refinement process to ensure that the user stories are feasible and 
can be completed within the Sprint.

Backlog refinement is an ongoing process of reviewing and updating the product backlog to ensure that it is accurate, up-to-date, and well-groomed. Backlog refinement 
activities include:

Adding new user stories and requirements: As the product evolves, new requirements may be identified and added to the backlog.

Clarifying user stories: User stories may need to be clarified or reworded to ensure that they are clear and concise.

Estimating user stories: The development team should estimate the effort required to complete each user story using techniques such as story points.

Prioritizing user stories: The Product Owner should regularly review and prioritize the backlog based on feedback from stakeholders, changes in the market, 
and the overall product vision and goals.

**GitHub workflow with ZenHub for project management**

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses version control software to manage software development projects. ZenHub is a project management tool that integrates
with GitHub to provide additional features for project management, such as kanban boards, sprint planning, and release management. Here is an overview of the 
workflow using GitHub and ZenHub for project management:

Set up the GitHub repository: Create a new GitHub repository for the project and invite team members to collaborate.

Create a backlog of issues: Use GitHub's issue tracker to create a backlog of issues and user stories. The issues should be labeled with the appropriate tags and 
milestones.

Install the ZenHub extension: Install the ZenHub extension for your web browser and connect it to your GitHub account.

Create a kanban board: Use ZenHub to create a kanban board to visualize the workflow of your project. The board should include columns for To Do, In Progress, 
and Done.

Plan sprints: Use ZenHub to plan sprints and assign issues to each sprint. The sprint planning should include estimating the effort required to complete each issue, 
based on story points or other estimation techniques.

Track progress: Use ZenHub's burndown charts to track progress during the sprint and ensure that the team is on track to meet the sprint goals.

Review and release: Use ZenHub to review the completed work and prepare for the release. The review process should include code reviews, testing, and documentation. 
Once the work is approved, use GitHub's release management features to release the new version of the software.

By using GitHub and ZenHub together, Agile teams can benefit from the version control and collaboration features of GitHub, as well as the additional project 
management features provided by ZenHub. This can help teams to be more efficient, organized, and transparent, and deliver higher quality software products.


**What are sprint planning and sprint milestones? How to create user stories and add them to milestones on ZenHub?**

Sprint planning is a key event in the Scrum framework where the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team collaborate to plan the upcoming sprint. 
During this meeting, the team reviews the product backlog, selects the user stories and requirements to be completed in the sprint, estimates the work required, 
and creates a sprint goal and plan.

Sprint milestones are a way to track the progress of the sprint and ensure that the team is on track to meet the sprint goal. Sprint milestones can include 
checkpoints such as design reviews, code reviews, and testing milestones. By tracking the milestones, the team can quickly identify and address any issues that 
may arise during the sprint.

To create user stories and add them to milestones on ZenHub, follow these steps:

Log in to your ZenHub account and select the repository you want to work with.

Navigate to the "Issues" tab and click the "New Issue" button.

In the issue creation form, enter the details of the user story, including the title, description, and any labels or milestones.

To add the user story to a milestone, select the appropriate milestone from the "Milestone" drop-down list.

Click the "Create issue" button to create the user story and add it to the backlog.


**What is a daily workflow in agile development? What is a daily standup? What is sprint retrospective and sprint reviews? Who are the potential attendees of these
meetings?**

The daily workflow in agile development typically includes a series of meetings and activities designed to ensure that the team is working effectively and 
collaboratively towards the sprint goals. Here are some of the key activities that may be included in the daily workflow:

Daily Standup: This is a short, daily meeting where the team gathers to discuss their progress, identify any obstacles or challenges, and plan their work for the day.
The meeting should be timeboxed to 15 minutes and each team member should answer the following three questions:
What did I do yesterday?
What am I planning to do today?
Are there any obstacles or challenges that I need help with?
Sprint Review: This is a meeting at the end of the sprint where the team demonstrates the completed work to the stakeholders and receives feedback. The review 
should include a demo of the working software and a discussion of the progress towards the sprint goals.

Sprint Retrospective: This is a meeting at the end of the sprint where the team reflects on their work and identifies areas for improvement. The retrospective 
should include a discussion of what went well, what could have been better, and action items for the next sprint.

The potential attendees of these meetings may include:

The Scrum Master: responsible for facilitating the meetings and ensuring that the team is following the agile principles and practices.
The Product Owner: responsible for setting the sprint goals and priorities, and ensuring that the work aligns with the overall product vision and strategy.
The Development Team: responsible for delivering the completed work and collaborating effectively to achieve the sprint goals.
Stakeholders: who may be interested in attending the sprint review to provide feedback and ensure that the work is aligned with their expectations.
